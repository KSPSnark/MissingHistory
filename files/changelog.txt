-- Releases above this line are for KSP 1.12 or newer --


Release v1.9.2 (2020-01-09)
* Update Stowaway crew cabin to fix a shader bug with ambient light. Thanks to Hex3 for catching and JadeOfMaar for providing a fixed model!

* Add the new "Stowaway" 1.875m crew cabin, courtesy of JadeOfMaar.
* [BUG] Accidentally included some files that try to add orange variants for Size4 nose code & tank skins that I was testing and didn't mean to actually ship.  DO NOT USE THESE VARIANTS, they don't work right and I didn't mean to release them.

Release v1.8 (2019-10-16)
* Compatibility update for KSP 1.8.  Changes as follows:

* Fix no-longer-accurate description in 1.25m engine plate. (Thanks to rwilkinson for spotting!)

Release v1.7.2 (2019-01-02)
* Update the exhaust plume on the KANDL engine (inadvertently omitted from release 1.7).
* Rename the KANDL engine to avoid colliding with other mods that resurrect this part.

* Thanks to JadeOfMaar from the KSP forums for kindly providing new exhaust plumes for the two engines!

Release v1.6.1 (2018-12-24)
* Move 1.25m engine plate down to "Advanced Construction" (in keeping with the KSP 1.6 parts rebalance).

Release v1.6 (2018-12-20)
* Update for KSP 1.6 compatibility.
* Reskinned Terrier removed (due to stock revamp).
* The 2.5m-3.75m adapter tank is removed (since a stock tank got added in this shape).

* Restore 1.25m engine plate to the mod, having fixed the bug that prevented it from working. (Thanks to JH4C in the KSP forums for detective work that led to the fix!)
* Update ModuleManager to 3.1.0, the latest version.

Release v1.4 (2018-10-15):
* Remove re-skin of 1.25m tanks, for KSP 1.5 compatibility.
* Skins *may* be re-added at some future date; this is a quick fix to keep the mod functional in KSP 1.5.

* Hopefully a future KSP patch will fix the bug so that the 1.25m engine plate becomes usable again.

Release v1.3.3 (2018-07-09):
* Fix a bug in the 1.25m engine plate that incorrectly set its ejection force. (Thanks to wile1411 in the KSP forums for catching!)
