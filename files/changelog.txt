Release v1.7.2 (2019-01-02)
* Update the exhaust plume on the KANDL engine (inadvertently omitted from release 1.7).
* Rename the KANDL engine to avoid colliding with other mods that resurrect this part.

Release v1.6.1 (2018-12-24)
* Move 1.25m engine plate down to "Advanced Construction" (in keeping with the KSP 1.6 parts rebalance).
* Add a short 1.875m-to-2.5m fuel tank adapter. Thanks to Tonka Crash in the KSP forums for suggesting!

Release v1.6 (2018-12-20)
* Update for KSP 1.6 compatibility.
* Reskinned Terrier removed (due to stock revamp).
* The 2.5m-3.75m adapter tank is removed (since a stock tank got added in this shape).

* Tweaked the FL-A10 Adapter to be a small fuel tank (with 0.3 tons of LFO) instead of just a structural part.

Release v1.4.1 (2018-10-19):
* Restore 1.25m engine plate to the mod, having fixed the bug that prevented it from working. (Thanks to JH4C in the KSP forums for detective work that led to the fix!)
* Update ModuleManager to 3.1.0, the latest version.

Release v1.4 (2018-10-15):

* Skins *may* be re-added at some future date; this is a quick fix to keep the mod functional in KSP 1.5.

* Fix a bug in the 1.25m engine plate that incorrectly set its ejection force. (Thanks to wile1411 in the KSP forums for catching!)
