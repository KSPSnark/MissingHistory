// When I initially added Porkjet's KANDL engine to this mod, like an idiot I
// didn't actually change the part's name.  I say "idiot" because I'm repurposing
// and tweaking someone else's publicly-licensed part, meaning that other people
// may do the same thing, which would cause a naming collision that will cause
// unfortunate hilarity when KSP tries to reconcile the two.  Oops.
//
// Anyway, this little patch is aimed at addressing that.  I've renamed the
// KANDL engine now, so I've got my own name and it won't conflict with other
// folks' version.  Since I (stupidly) released MissingHistory version 1.7
// with Porkjet's original name on this engine, I can't just delete it, beccause
// that would cause anyone who downloaded my 1.7 and launched with the KANDL
// to end up with a broken save that has unloadable ships in it.  That would be
// mean of me.  Therefore, I'm adding a clone of the part, with the original name
// that I (shouldn't have) released with, to prevent that sort of breakage. Anyone
// building a *new* ship with MissingHistory 1.7.2 or later will get the new,
// renamed version. However, anyone who has linuxgurugamer's "Recycled Parts" mod
// *does* have Porkjet's originally-named part, so doesn't need this cloned version.
//
// TL;DR:
// - I goofed. This fixes my goof.
// - When resurrecting / repurposing someone else's part, CHANGE THE NAME. Lesson learned.
