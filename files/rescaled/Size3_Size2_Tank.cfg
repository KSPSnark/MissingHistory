// A fueled adapter tank for transition from 2.5m to 3.75m. NOTE: This
// part is now deprecated, since the stock 2.5-3.75m adapter got fuel
// tankage added to it in KSP 1.6. Therefore, this part is no longer
// needed. In order not to break people's save-games, the part isn't
// being actually deleted, but it's now "hidden" in R&D and the vehicle
// editor, so that it won't clutter things up.
