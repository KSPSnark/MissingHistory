## What it does

Adds various parts that I wish _MakingHistory_ had included, but didn't.

In general, the parts added here break down into two categories:

* Parts that are simply 1.875m scaled versions of stock KSP parts. No new models, just ModuleManager tweaks.
* Integration of some Porkjet PartOverhaul models, reskinning some stock parts and adding a few new ones.
* Addition of a new 2-kerbal command pod that's 1.875m at the base and 1.25m at the top.

 
## How to install

Unzip the contents of "GameData" to your GameData folder, same as with most mods. (Note, includes ModuleManager.)
